      <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 11/22/2025</p>

      <p>Welcome to PlayTime!</p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the PlayTime mobile
        application ("App") provided by Sempurna, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). By
        downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by
        these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Scope of License</h2>
      <p>
        We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
        license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes on
        devices owned or controlled by you, subject to these Terms. This license
        does not allow you to modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the
        App.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Privacy and Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. Please review our
        <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how we collect,
        use, and store your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Offline-First Architecture:</strong> PlayTime is designed as an
        "offline-first" application. While we use cloud synchronization to back
        up your data, a significant portion of your data (including PTO balances
        and settings) is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for
        maintaining the security of your device to protect this local data.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        To use certain features of the App, you may need to create an account.
        You agree to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information.</li>
        <li>Maintain the security of your password and identification.</li>
        <li>
          Accept all responsibility for any and all activities that occur under
          your account.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You may delete your account at any
        time via the "Profile" section of the App. Upon deletion, your data will
        be permanently removed from our servers. Please note that data stored
        locally on your device may need to be manually cleared by uninstalling
        the App.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Integrations (Google Calendar)</h2>
      <p>
        PlayTime integrates with Google Calendar to sync your Time Off requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Authorization:</strong> By connecting your Google Calendar, you
        grant us permission to view and edit events on the calendar you select.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Usage:</strong> We only use this integration to add,
        update, or remove PTO events created by PlayTime. We do not read, store,
        or analyze your other calendar events.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We are not responsible for any data loss or
        synchronization errors caused by the Google Calendar API or third-party
        service outages.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Accuracy of Calculations</h2>
      <p>
        PlayTime is a forecasting and tracking tool designed to assist you in
        managing your Paid Time Off.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Not Official Record:</strong> The calculations provided by the
        App are estimates based on the settings you input (Accrual Rate,
        Carryover Limit, etc.). This App does <strong>not</strong> serve as an
        official HR record or a legal payroll document.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for verifying
        the accuracy of your PTO balance with your employer's official records.
        We are not liable for any discrepancies between the App's projections
        and your actual employment benefits.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments (If Applicable)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Free Use:</strong> The core features of PlayTime are currently
        provided free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to introduce premium
        features or subscription fees in the future. Any changes to pricing will
        be communicated to you in advance.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The App, including its design, code, graphics, and content, is the
        property of Sempurna LLC and is protected by copyright and other
        intellectual property laws. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or
        attempt to extract the source code of the App.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>"AS IS" Basis:</strong> The App is provided on an "AS IS" and
        "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We disclaim all warranties, whether express or
        implied, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
        particular purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> To the fullest extent
        permitted by law, Sempurna LLC shall not be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss
        of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of the App.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We verify the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App
        immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason,
        including breach of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any
        changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last
        Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after any changes
        constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
      </p>
