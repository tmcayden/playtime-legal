      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 11/22/2025</p>

      <p>
        Sempurna LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the PlayTime mobile
        application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding
        the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our
        App and the choices you have associated with that data.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
        accordance with this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect several different types of information for various purposes
        to provide and improve our Service to you.
      </p>

      <h3>A. Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        When you create an account, we may ask you to provide us with certain
        personally identifiable information, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for authentication, account
          recovery, and integration with Google services.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Used to personalize your profile.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. User Content (PTO Data)</h3>
      <p>To function as a PTO tracking tool, we collect and store:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PTO accrual settings (accrual rates, carryover limits).</li>
        <li>Dates and duration of time-off requests.</li>
        <li>Balance calculations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Google User Data (Restricted Scopes)</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to connect your Google Calendar, we access the following
        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Email Address:</strong> To identify which calendar is
          being synced.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calendar Events:</strong> We require
          <strong>write access</strong> to your Google Calendar to automatically
          create, update, and delete "Out of Office" or "PTO" events based on
          your input in the PlayTime App.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tokens:</strong> We securely store authentication tokens
          (Refresh Tokens) to maintain this connection without requiring you to
          log in repeatedly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>To provide the Service:</strong> Calculating your PTO balances
          and forecasting future availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To Sync Data:</strong> We use cloud services (Supabase and
          PowerSync) to synchronize your data across your devices so you don't
          lose it if you lose your phone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To Integrate with Google Calendar:</strong> Specifically to
          create events on your calendar representing your time off.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use Disclosure)</h2>
      <p>
        PlayTime's use and transfer to any other app of information received
        from Google APIs will adhere to the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"
          target="_blank"
          >Google API Services User Data Policy</a
        >, including the Limited Use requirements.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Specifically regarding your Google Calendar data:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>No Human Access:</strong> We do not allow humans to read your
          Google Calendar data unless we have your affirmative agreement for
          specific messages (e.g., for support), or where necessary for security
          purposes or to comply with applicable laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Advertising:</strong> We do not use or transfer your Google
          data for serving advertisements, including retargeting, personalized,
          or interest-based advertising.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only request access to the
          specific calendars necessary to perform the syncing feature. We do not
          read or store the details of your <em>other</em> (non-PlayTime)
          calendar events.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Your profile and PTO data are stored
        securely in the cloud using Supabase (an enterprise-grade database
        provider). All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Local Storage (Offline-First):</strong> PlayTime creates a local
        copy of your database on your device (using SQLite) to allow the app to
        function without an internet connection. You are responsible for
        maintaining the security of your mobile device (e.g., using a
        passcode/FaceID) to protect this local data.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your Personal Data only for as
        long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You have the right to delete your
        account and all associated data at any time.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the PlayTime App.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Profile</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Delete Account</strong> and confirm.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Result:</strong> This action triggers a permanent deletion of
          your user profile, authentication credentials, settings, and all
          time-off entries from our servers. This action is irreversible.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>6. Service Providers</h2>
      <p>
        We may employ third-party companies to facilitate our Service ("Service
        Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, or to assist us in
        analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to
        your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
        obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Backend database and Authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Google:</strong> Calendar Integration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under
        the age of 13.
      </p>

        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and
